# AVL-TREE
An AVL tree is a balanced binary search tree where the height difference between the left and right subtrees of each node is limited to -1, 0, or 1.. The balance property ensures that operations such as search, insertion, and deletion have a time complexity of O(log n), making AVL trees efficient for these operations. Rotations are employed to maintain balance after insertions or deletions, fixing any potential violations of the balance property.
